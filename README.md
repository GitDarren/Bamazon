* Built on javascript and node.js to run in the console using MySQL integration
* Utilizes Inquirer and Chalk packages to engage the user, display their response and make it look colorful.

## Description of App

* Display an table of products the user can choose to buy.
* Prompt the user to select one of the items for sale.
* Prompt the user to enter how many of the item they would like to buy. 
* If there is insufficient stock to fulfill their order, they are notified of that and re-prompted to select and item.
* If there is sufficient stock, the app will notify them that their order went through.
* The app will provide them a re-cap of what they are purchasing and give them a grand total.
* After they are given a grand total, they are asked if they wish to make another purchase.
